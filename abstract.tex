Measure Theory is the study of Measure. Here we try extend the notion of size of interval to more general sets and other notion such as mass and probability of events. We know the size of a interval in $\mathds{R}$ is 
its length. Then by instinct we say in $\mathds{R}^{2}$ it will be area and in $\mathds{R}^{3}$ it will be volume of sets. Finding more general notion of size of
interval leads us to concept of measure.

Measure Theory is foundation in Probability Theory, Integration Theory, Quantum Physics and Physics in general. Measure is one of the fundamental
concept of mathematics but it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries measure theory become a branch of mathematics. 
Emile Borel, Henri Lebessgue, Georg Cantor, Giuseppe Vitali are some name of mathematician responsible for modern measure theory.

We start with length of interval. From this outer measure is constructed even though it looks promising but it fails to have crucial property. This unfortunate result leads us to \sig-algebra and measurable space. From there we construct measure and measurable function in more abstract context. Taking restriction on outer measure we construct Lebesgue Measure
which leads to more general theory of integration then Riemann integration.
