    I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Ujjal Debnath 
    for his exemplary guidance and constant encouragement throughout the course of this project. 

    \vspace{5mm}
    I am grateful to IIEST, Shibpur for providing me with the opportunity to complete my dissertation. 
    In this project I have tried to give a short overview of \textbf{Measure Theory}.

    \vspace{5mm}
    I would like to extend my deepest gratitude and thanks to my parents without whose constant support and encouragement this project would never have been completed. 
    I would also like to thank my friends for their valuable suggestions and support.
